# Random-Platform-Walk
A project that uses the concept of fitness to piece together the solution to a random platformer.  

The project generates strings of random characters between a set range.  These represent actions, moving up, left, and right.  The program then uses these strings to attempt to complete some platformer game.  Depending on which string was the most successful at completing the game, a new set of strings is created using the previous best as a base.
